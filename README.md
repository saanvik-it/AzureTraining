## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### 1. What is cloud computing? üåê
<div class="answer">
<p>Cloud computing is a technology model that delivers computing services over the internet ("the cloud"), including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. It offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale by eliminating the need to own and maintain physical infrastructure.</p>
</div>

### 2. What are the Cloud computing service models? ‚òÅÔ∏è
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., Azure VMs, Storage)
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure (e.g., Azure App Service, Azure Functions)
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis (e.g., Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365)

### 3. Cloud deployment models
- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them
- **Private Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds with orchestration between the two
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using cloud services from multiple cloud providers
- **Community Cloud**: Infrastructure shared by several organizations with common concerns

### 4. Difference between ASM vs ARM deployment model
- **ASM (Azure Service Management)**: The classic/legacy deployment model where resources were managed individually
- **ARM (Azure Resource Manager)**: The current deployment model that enables you to work with resources as a group, provides better security, tagging, and template-based deployments

### 5. What is ARM?
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription. ARM allows you to deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.

### 6. What is a resource group?
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.

### 7. What is Azure RBAC?
Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources. It allows you to grant users only the amount of access they need to perform their jobs, following the principle of least privilege.

### 8. What is Azure policy and how to implement it?
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.

Implementation steps:
1. Define your policy using JSON format or use built-in policy definitions
2. Create a policy assignment (scope can be management group, subscription, or resource group)
3. Review compliance data and remediate non-compliant resources

### 9. What are Azure resource locks?
Azure resource locks prevent accidental deletion or modification of your Azure resources. There are two types of locks:
- **CanNotDelete**: Authorized users can read and modify a resource, but they can't delete it
- **ReadOnly**: Authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update it

### 10. Azure PowerShell command to login to portal
```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

### 11. Azure PowerShell command to create a resource group and VM
```powershell
# Create a resource group
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyResourceGroup" -Location "East US"

# Create a VM
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "MyVM" -Location "East US" -VirtualNetworkName "MyVNet" -SubnetName "Default" -SecurityGroupName "MyNSG" -PublicIpAddressName "MyPublicIP" -OpenPorts 80,3389
```

### 12. CLI command to login to portal
```bash
az login
```

### 13. What are Azure tags?
Azure tags are name-value pairs that you can apply to Azure resources for logical organization. Tags allow you to categorize resources by purpose, environment, department, cost center, lifecycle, etc. Tags are especially useful for resource management, cost tracking, and automation.

### 14. How many ways we can create resources on Azure portal?
Resources in Azure can be created through multiple methods:
1. Azure Portal (GUI)
2. Azure PowerShell
3. Azure CLI

- Isolate resources based on their function or security requirements

### 64. If I have two VNETs and each VNET has some resources, will those resources be able to communicate by default?
No, by default, resources in different VNETs cannot communicate with each other. You need to explicitly configure connectivity between VNETs using one of these methods:
- VNET Peering
- VNET-to-VNET VPN connection
- Azure ExpressRoute
- Azure Virtual WAN

### 65. What is Azure VNET Peering?
Azure VNET Peering is a mechanism that connects two virtual networks seamlessly through the Microsoft backbone network. Once peered, the VNETs appear as one for connectivity purposes. Benefits include:
- Low-latency, high-bandwidth connection between resources
- No public internet, gateways, or encryption needed
- No downtime during setup
- Traffic stays on the Microsoft backbone network

### 66. Types of VNET Peering
- **Regional VNET Peering**: Connects VNETs within the same Azure region
- **Global VNET Peering**: Connects VNETs across different Azure regions

### 67. How to block communication from one VNET to another VNET when you have VNET Peering?
To block specific communication between peered VNETs:
1. Create Network Security Groups (NSGs) with deny rules
2. Apply these NSGs to the subnets or network interfaces
3. Configure User-Defined Routes (UDRs) to control traffic flow
4. Use Azure Firewall or NVAs (Network Virtual Appliances) for more advanced filtering

### 68. What is Azure VNET to VNET VPN?
Azure VNET to VNET VPN is a connection that uses IPsec/IKE VPN tunnels to connect two virtual networks. Unlike VNET peering, it:
- Encrypts traffic between the VNETs
- Uses VPN gateways in each VNET
- Can work across subscriptions and tenants
- Supports transitive routing scenarios

### 69. What is the difference between VNET Peering and VNET to VNET VPN?
**VNET Peering**:

6. **Verify connectivity**:
   - Test connections between on-premises and Azure resources
   - Configure redundancy if needed

### 75. What is Point to Site VPN?
Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN is a connection from an individual client computer to an Azure virtual network. It's useful for remote workers who need to connect to Azure VNets from any location. The connection is established by starting it from the client computer, which authenticates to the Azure VPN gateway.

### 76. How to configure Point to Site VPN step by step?
1. **Create a Virtual Network in Azure**:
   - Define address space and subnets
   - Create a gateway subnet (minimum /27)

2. **Create a VPN Gateway**:
   - Create a Virtual Network Gateway with VPN type
   - Select a gateway SKU that supports P2S
   - Assign a public IP address

3. **Configure authentication method**:
   - Generate or upload certificates for authentication
   - For certificate authentication:
     - Generate a root certificate
     - Create client certificates from the root certificate
     - Upload the root certificate public key to Azure

4. **Configure the Point-to-Site configuration**:
   - Define the client address pool (IP addresses for connected clients)
   - Select tunnel type (SSTP, IKEv2, or OpenVPN)
   - Add the root certificate information

5. **Download and install the VPN client**:
   - Download the VPN client configuration package from Azure Portal
   - Install the package on client computers
   - Import client certificates if needed

6. **Connect from client computers**:
   - Use the installed VPN client to connect
   - Authenticate using the client certificate
   - Verify connectivity to Azure resources

### 77. What is NSG (Network Security Group)?
A Network Security Group (NSG) is a fundamental security component in Azure that acts as a basic stateful firewall. It contains a list of security rules that allow or deny network traffic to resources connected to Azure Virtual Networks. NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces.

### 78. What is ASG (Application Security Group)?
Application Security Groups (ASGs) enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure. You can group VMs and define network security policies based on these groups. ASGs allow you to reuse your security policy at scale without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses.

### 79. Difference between NSG vs ASG
**Network Security Group (NSG)**:
- Acts as a basic firewall with allow/deny rules
- Can be associated with subnets or NICs
- Rules based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols
- Stateful filtering of traffic
- Can work independently

**Application Security Group (ASG)**:
- Logical grouping of VMs by application role
- Cannot be applied directly to resources (used within NSG rules)
- Simplifies security rule management
- Eliminates the need to maintain explicit IP addresses in security rules
- Must be used in conjunction with NSGs

### 84. What is priority in NSG?
Priority in NSG is a number between 100 and 4096, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers. Once a rule is matched, processing stops, and no further rules are evaluated. This means more specific rules should have lower priority numbers than more general rules.

### 85. How to block internet connection to your VM?
To block internet connection to a VM:
1. Remove any associated public IP addresses
2. Create an NSG with a deny rule for outbound traffic to Internet destination
3. Apply the NSG to the VM's network interface or subnet
4. Ensure no route table is directing traffic to the internet
5. Use Azure Firewall or NVA to control outbound traffic centrally
